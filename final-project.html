    <p>As baseball’s offseason kicks into high gear, fanbases around the country are turning their attention to their own team’s needs, and how to fulfill them. Whether it’s landing an elite pitcher or hitter, many are dreaming of their franchises building a World Series roster.</p> 

    <p>But, everything comes at a price. That price can be other players via trade, or often, it’s also monetary.</p> 

    <p>Payroll is one of the most heavily-debated topics in baseball today. And, part of that is how it contrasts to other sports, such the hard salary cap seen in football.</p> 

    <p>Dr. Jeremy Losak, an assistant professor specializing in sports analytics at Syracuse University’s Falk College, says that without a salary cap or floor in baseball, organizations are given more flexibility to run their teams than in any other sport, creating a system where a large portion of talent funnels towards several teams.</p>

    <p>Some take this to the max, spending any money burning in their pockets to build a championship contender. Others hover as low as possible, maximizing profits by lowering their costs, and receiving revenue-sharing from the high-spending teams.</p>

    <p>“You could have certain teams, like the Oakland Athletics spending 70 to 80 million dollars a year on payroll,” Losak said. “And then on the other end of the spectrum, you could have a team like the Mets, spend 350 million dollars on payroll."</p>

    <p>This unbalance is seen the most in free agency, a process that gives players the opportunity to choose their next team (and receive a hefty payday in the process), but also puts each organization to the ultimate test. It separates the committed teams from the apathetic, and is usually dominated by those willing to go out of their way to add talent.</p>

    <p>“It’s very much tied to market,” Losak said. “The value of an extra win in New York and Los Angeles is significantly greater than the added value of a win in Baltimore.”</p>

    <p>Then there’s the San Francisco Giants. An ambitious team often connected to pursuing superstars- from Bryce Harper in the winter of 2018, to Aaron Judge last year, to Shohei Ohtani this year- and yet, to the dismay of a fanbase begging to have a superstar to root for, the Giants never walk away with one.</p> 

    <p>As they get caught in the middle, between the teams that land big free agents, and the teams that move on the margins, many question their current standing amongst baseball’s other franchises. Are they the definitive, big market high-rollers that they’ve been projected to be? Or, are they operating in disguise, acting as spenders to fend off a fanbase that may otherwise become disillusioned?</p>

    <p>The answer is complex, but in looking at their spending relative to other teams in the last 25 years, the answer would be no, they usually aren’t splurging. Since MLB expanded to 30 teams in 1998, the Giants have never operated in the bottom half of the payroll, but aside from a post-championship surge in the 2010s, they’ve never committed to being at the top, either.</p> 

    <p>This surge was quickly leveled, with the hiring of new baseball president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi in 2018, and with it came specific cases to go along with this. The unwillingness to extend Kevin Gausman in 2021 for instance, added more doubt to the franchise’s direction, for a fanbase already feeling uneasy. This all came in a division where their California rivals, the Dodgers and Padres, were engaging in an arms race of their own.</p> 

    <p><em>So if they aren’t spending, how far behind has it placed them?</em></p>

    <p>Looking at the overall franchise, the Giants have seen relatively consistent success in a 30-team MLB, ranking 6th in wins. Their winningest season, not just in this era, but in franchise history occurred in 2021, a season where their payroll continued to dip.</p> 

    <p>But to get to the next level, where they may be able to reach the 21/25 playoff appearances the Yankees achieved, or the 10/11 division titles benchmark the Dodgers have set, it involves maximizing your window. A window that Losak says alternates between contention and rebuilding.</p> 

    <p>“In baseball, everything works in cycles,” Losak said. “But money allows you to keep those competitive windows open, [for] longer.”</p> 

    <p>Spending isn’t limited to the main roster a team pays for, and free agency isn’t the only way to get better. Losak looks at teams like the Dodgers and Astros, who used their resources to extend young players, and build on an established core. And there’s the Mets, who weaponized money at the 2023 trade deadline to add to their farm system, through taking back salary.</p> 

    <p>Losak believes the Giants have tried to spend in good-faith, but still lack the homegrown success to currently build a sustainable contender.</p>

    <p>“Investment into scouting, [and] investment into analytics definitely matter,” Losak said. “Think of it this way: you either sign a 5th outfielder for a million dollars. Or, you could build out an entire scouting apparatus with that same money.”</p>

    <p>The message is clear though; in order to succeed, every front office has to be proactive, no matter the direction.</p>

<div class="conclusion">
  <p>As of December 18, the Giants have been proactive. They’ve spent the 4th most among all teams this offseason. Their six-year, $113 million contract to Jung-hoo Lee stands as the 4th highest contract dolled out; it only trails Ohtani, and the extensions of Aaron Nola and Tyler Glasnow by the Phillies and Dodgers respectively. At the moment, an irate Giants fanbase has been pacified with a single name- a name that cost the Giants more money than they’ve ever spent on an outside free agent.</p> 

  <p>Losak expected this.</p>

  <p>“The one thing about sports fans is we’ll complain and we’ll moan,” Losak said. “But as soon as you have those top level players again, fans typically come swarming back.”</p>
